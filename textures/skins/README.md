Ok, so for a quick tutorial on how to make your own skin:

1 - Go to pixilart, select a 1024x1024 canvas, make your drawing, export it as png in x5 (5120x5120).
2 - go to textures/skins and create a folder with the name of your skin.
3 - add your png and create a info.json with this template: {
    "name": "NAME",
    "description": "DESCRIPTION"
}
4 - Thats it.
